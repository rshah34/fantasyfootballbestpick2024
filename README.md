# The Fantasy Football "Best Pick" App - 2024/2025 - IN PROGRESS
Optimal Fantasy Football Drafting at each position in a Snake Draft for the upcoming 2024 NFL Season. The app will simply ask of some standard information
regarding your league, including the number of players in your league and your current draft position. You can input which players you may have on your watchlist,
or you can ask the app the best picks available for your team for the upcoming season. Point projections are from ESPN records, and selections are based on optimization
for your team throughout the season, best fit, etc.

The following pages are included in the app:

1. A settings page where you establish the number of players in your league and the pick selection you have in the Snake Draft. Here, you are able to restart your draft if necessary
or you can go back to a certain point in the draft and edit the picks of other players.
2. A page with your current team, including the players already selected and their statistics (which includes, but not limited to: position, bye week, projected points, rank by position).
The page will have the status of the draft noted at the top, and the page will also have a drop-down option to select other teams to view their current teams at that point in the draft.
3. A page of the live draft. This page will contain filters for specific players so that you can manually select specific players, and will also tell you the history of the draft picks that have been taken prior to the current pick you are at. You will be able to manually select the player to draft once your pick arrives.
4. A page of where the algorithm will calculate the optimal player to draft at the specific position in the draft you are at. Judging by the total amount of points you may be able to accumulate across the entire season, as well as by the positions most needed at that point, the app will calculate which few players may be the best selections, and you will be able to select them directly from that screen, or you can select another player from the live draft page. Upon completion of the draft, you will receive a review of how your draft went, by telling you most projected points per week.
